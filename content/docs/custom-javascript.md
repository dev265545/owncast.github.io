If you have some Javascript you need to run when your Owncast web page loads, you can add it to the Javascript editor in the admin.

{{<versionsupport feature="Adding custom Javascript" version="0.1.0">}}

Some examples of reasons you might need this:

- Adding privacy-respecting analytics.
- Initializing a payment processor you have embedded on your page.
- Use Javascript to manipulate the interface.

## Warning

Double check your Javascript. Any incorrect syntax or errors that you insert into the page may create errors and stop the page from loading or functionality from working.
