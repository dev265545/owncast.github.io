Your stream's chat can be customized with your own custom emoji. You can add as many as you'd like and they'll be available to use in chat.

## In the Admin

By visiting the chat custom emoji page in the admin located at `/admin/chat/emojis` you can add and remove images that are available to chat participants.

{{<versionsupport feature="Emoji management" version="0.1.0">}}

## Manual management

You can manually add or remove custom emoji images in the `data/emoji` directory on your filesystem.

## Bundled emoji images
