By creating a `data/public` directory and putting your own files there you can serve any assets that you wish to make publicly available for any reason.

{{<versionsupport feature="Custom public assets" version="0.1.0">}}

Some exmples of reasons you might want to take advantage of this:

- Making a CSS font available so you can reference it in your custom CSS.
- You have images you wish to use in your page content.
- Some arbitrary files that you want people to download have no other place to be hosted.
